            I am a passionate MERN Stack Developer with hands-on experience
            building real-world web applications using React, Node.js,
            Express, and MongoDB.
            </p>

            <p>
            I enjoy solving problems, writing clean code, and learning new
            technologies. I have built multiple projects including
            interactive games, management systems, and full-stack web apps.

            Currently, I am focused on improving my data structures,
            backend architecture, and system design skills to grow as a
            professional software engineer.
